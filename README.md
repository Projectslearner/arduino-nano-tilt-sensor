# Tilt Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Tilt Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to detect tilt using a tilt sensor. Tilt sensors, also known as tilt switches or mercury switches, are simple devices that can detect changes in orientation or tilt. They are commonly used in applications where detecting tilt or motion is essential, such as alarm systems, vehicle security systems, and orientation-sensitive devices.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Tilt Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Tilt Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the tilt sensor to a digital pin on the Arduino Nano (e.g., pin 2).
   - Connect one terminal of the tilt sensor to GND (ground) on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the tilt sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Tilt the sensor and observe the state change displayed in the serial monitor.
   - Return the sensor to its original position and observe the state change again.

#### Applications

- **Orientation Detection:** Use tilt sensors to detect changes in orientation or tilt in devices or systems.
- **Security Systems:** Implement tilt sensors in alarm or security systems to trigger alerts in case of unauthorized movement or tampering.
- **Robotics:** Integrate tilt sensors into robotic systems to detect tipping or tilting and adjust operations accordingly.

#### Notes

- Ensure the tilt sensor is securely mounted and calibrated for accurate tilt detection.
- Experiment with different sensitivity levels or threshold values to fine-tune the tilt detection according to the specific requirements of your application.
